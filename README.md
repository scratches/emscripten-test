A [bug in nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/188143) makes it painful to use `binaryen` or `emscripten` which depends on it. This project was used to test a workaround in `shell.nix`. However, it's even more painful once you get it working in [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) because the `/nix` volume is [not cached across restarts](https://github.com/xtruder/nix-devcontainer/issues/11). That's why we are using `docker-compose.yml` since it isn't affected by the cache bug.
